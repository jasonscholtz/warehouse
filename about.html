        <p class="lead">The wareHOUSE is twenty thousand square feet dedicated to the private collection of Sue and John Wieland.</p>
        <p class="lead">The artwork is based on the theme of the house as a central image and includes contemporary artists from around the world who work in painting, photography, sculpture, installation and video.</p>
        <h2>history</h2>
        <p>Sue and John Wieland began collecting art in the mid-1980s. A short while later, they decided to focus their purchases on art that features a house, a reflection of Johnâ€™s business as a homebuilder in the Southeast.</p>
        <p>Their earlier acquisitions concentrated on artists working in the United States. In 2005, when Rebecca Dimling Cochran joined them as curator, their collecting expanded to include both national and international artists.</p>
        <p>For many years, the art hung in the corporate offices of John Wieland Homes and Neighborhoods. In 2010, the Wielands created the wareHOUSE, where the majority of the artwork now resides.</p>
